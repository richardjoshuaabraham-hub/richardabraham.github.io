# BIM Portfolio Website — Style Matched + Galleries

This build matches the dark, glass + blueprint background aesthetic from your reference video,
and includes responsive galleries per project.

## Replace portrait
Replace `assets/portrait_placeholder.svg` with your own photo (e.g., `assets/portrait.jpg`) and update in `index.html`.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Upload all files (including `assets/`) into your repo root
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main → /(root)

## 3D MEP Background
Background image is `assets/bg_mep.png` generated from a coordination model view and tinted to match the accent color.
